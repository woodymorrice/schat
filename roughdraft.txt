Rough Draft
Part A.1
windows_main.c will contain the main functionality for question A.1.
The source files that invoke the other thread libraries will follow a similar naming convention.
THREAD* create_parent(int threads, int deadline, int size) will create a parent thread
When the deadline is hit parent thread will wake up and keepRunning will be set to false
THREAD* create_child(int size) will be called by the parent thread to create the number of children
child thread function will contain a while loop that checks keepRunning and exit and prints appropriate information when keepRunning is set to false.
The square root function will be placed in square.c and linked via square.h.


Part C
list functions will be implemented exactly as outlined in the assignment specification
list.h will contain the function headers for all list functions, and definitions for LIST and NODE data structures
list_adders.c will contain list_add(), list_insert(), list_append(), list_prepend(), list_concat()
list_movers.c will contain list_first(), list_last(), list_next(), list_prev()
list_removers.c list_curr(), list_count(), list_remove(), list_free(), list_trim()
LIST data structure will contain a void pointer to the head node and a void pointer to the tail node
NODE data structure will contain a void pointer to the contained data (any type), as well as a LIST* to the previous node, and a LIST* to the next node, both of which will be NULL by default
mytestlist.c main() function will contain the test driver for all list functions
all list components (except mytestlist.c) will be packaged using the ar function
