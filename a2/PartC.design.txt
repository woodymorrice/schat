// Should describe our solution strategy,
// including general pseudocode

** Design Details **
Our solution will consist of 6 main functions. The mainp() function
will initialize the five necessary threads. The first thread will
run the function sGetInput(), which waits for user input, records
the characters typed, and upon reading a newline character, sends
everything that has been recorded up to that point in a message to
the server.
The second thread runs sServer(), which receives messages from
sGetInput(), and places them in a list.
The third thread runs sSendData(), which waits for an item to be
added to the message list of the server function, then takes that
item off the list, and transmits it over the network via UDP
protocol to any remote UNIX processes that are listening on the
specified port.
The fourth thread runs sGetData(), which listens on the specified
port for UDP packets being sent, and retrieves them.
The fifth thread runs sDisplayData(), which prints the messages
received from the network to the local terminal.

** Pseudocode **
mainp()
    initialize threads

sGetInput()
    wait for input from keyboard
        if input is exit command
            send exit message to all processes
            exit
        if input is newline
            send all recorded input to server process
        else
            record input

sServer()
    wait for messages from server
        if message received
            add data package to list
            send message to sSendData() that a data package is available 

sSendData()
    wait for message from server
        if message received
            convert message data to universal type
            transmit data over UDP

sGetData()
    listen on port for datagram
        if datagram received
            convert message data to local type
            add data to list
            send message to sDisplayData() that data is available

sDisplayData()
    wait for message from sGetData()
        if message received
            display message data on local console
