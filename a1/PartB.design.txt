# Design Documentation for Part B

# Work Plan
Woody will be in charge of design and implementation for part B.

# Design Details
I redesigned the bash script based on input I received from
phase 1 and 2. The bash script first checks the command line argument
and makes sure the user is using the correct OS for that particular
version of partA. If not, the script exits.
Then the script reads through each line of the input file, reads the
first three white space separated arguments into a variables and
discards any remaining arguments (by reading them into a garbage
variable).
It then checks that each argument is a positive integer and is
within the acceptable range for that argument. Then it executes
the chosen partA program with the provided arguments.

# Implementation Details
Regular expressions are used to verify all arguments.
