Skeleton programs
- function headers + header files for interfacing between modules
- only need functions to check for correct type and range of parameter values
  - and print out "Go to procedure X" where X is the name of the procedure executing
  - or "Error in procedure X: invalid parameter Y" if the caller passed in the wrong params
- so main() must call every function to check error conditions and return proper error values
Makefile
- compiles Part A.1 and Part C
  - Part C makes a library named liblist.a
- uses if statements to check the OS and only compiles Linux or Windows code appropriately
mytestlist.c
mytestlist
- executable compiled by Makefile
332-style-guidelines-team14.txt
